*business setting 
*Someone is just talking too fucking much 

Corporate fuck is droning on and on and on 

Zach angry, flips the scripts, "I have control, I get to talk AHAHHHH"

1. Known talker controlling meeting
2. Flips the script and controls them 



Nerds Gummy 1 (Nathan)

- 4 Boys horror. Screen cap of joining Zuumb.com maybe a silly robot says hello and you join. 
- Same person with the same shirt starts walking in the background
- Someone goes off the rails and gets heated. They eventually gets shrunk down.
- Jump cut to alternating shirts, things are changing.
- Once a person talks for too long and gets dropped they rejoin in on many devices
- things get progressively crazier and crazier until the video just ends. 
- Everyone's crazy, and yells until someone finally slams their fist down and says "This is madness, we must all share our time." Zuumb.com logo.


The Gag (Zach):

Jump into generic business meeting - maybe freinds chatting 
He has become conscious that his time is limited
He is running from rom to room tyring to get more time to speak 

All of us are on the opposite of nates server
I invite another guy who actually sucks - tom
He is hogging the airwaves - at first zuumb is working and everyone is happy
Tom then figures out the workaround and starts joining as a bunch of different users 
We all then disucss the awesome features of zuumb com
